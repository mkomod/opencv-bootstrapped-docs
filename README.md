# OpenCV 4.1.x Bootstrapped Docs

Documentation for OpenCV with a more elegant and responsive theme. The original doxygen theme does not play well with smaller screens / when halving the window. 

To use the docs run:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/mkomod/opencv-bootstrapped-docs
```

This form of the docs should serve as a convenient means by which to read the content.


## Known Issues

Some of the known limitations include:

 - Lack of search
 - Large Code snippets (C++ section mainly) are not shown
